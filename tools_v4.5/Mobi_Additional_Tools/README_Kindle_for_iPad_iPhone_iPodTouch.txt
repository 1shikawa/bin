Kindle for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad


The Kindle application for iOS (iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad) uses a PID derived from the serial number of the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. Kindlepid.py is a python script that turns the serial number into the equivalent PID, which can then be used with the MobiDeDRM script.

So, to remove the DRM from (Mobipocket) Kindle books downloaded to your iPhone/iPodTouch/iPad, you’ll need the latest toolsvx.x.zip archive and
some way to extract the book files from the backup of your device on your computer. There are several free tools around to do this.

Double-click on KindlePID.pyw to get your device’s PID, then use the extractor to get your book files, then double-click on MobiDeDRM.pyw with the PID and the files to get Drm-free versions of your books.

Kindlefix gives you another way to use the PID generated by kindlepid. Some ebook stores and libraries will accept the PIDs generated by kindlepid (some won’t), and you can then download ebooks from the store or library encrypted to work with your Kindle. Except they don’t. There’s a flag byte set in encrypted Kindle ebooks, and Kindles and the Kindle app won’t read encrypted mobipocket ebooks unless that flag is set. Kindlefix will set that flag for you. If your library have Mobipocket ebooks to lend and will accept your Kindle’s PID, you can now check out library ebooks, run kindlefix on them, and then read them on your Kindle, and when your loan period ends, they’ll automatically become unreadable.

To extract the files from your iPod Touch (not archived Kindle ebooks, but ones actually on your iPod Touch) it’s necessary to first do a back-up of the iPod Touch using iTunes. That creates a backup file on your Mac, and you can then extract the Mobipocket files from that using iPhone/ipod Touch Backup Extractor – free software from here: http://supercrazyawesome.com/

Ok, so that will get your the .azw Kindle Mobipocket files.

Now you need the PID used to encrypt them. To get that you’ll need your iPod Touch UDID number – you can find it in iTunes when your iPod Touch is connected in the Summary page – click on the serial number and it changes to the (40 digit!) UDID. 

And then you need to double-click the KindlePID.pyw script and enter your 40 digit UDID in the window and hit "Start".

 and you should get back a response something like:

iPhone serial number (UDID) detected
Mobipocked PID for iPhone serial# FOURTYDIGITUDIDNUMBERGIVENHERE is TENDIGITPID

which gives you the PID to be used with MobiDeDRM to de-drm the files you extracted.

All of these scripts are gui python programs.   Python 2.X (32 bit) is already installed in Mac OSX and Linux.  We recommend ActiveState's Active Python Version 2.X (32 bit) for Windows users.
